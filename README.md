# Sprint 1

- **Note**: All User Stories are expressed as user stories if you click into the details of a PBI. The titles of the PBIs are shorter on the backlog for brevities sake.

- **Forecasted Points**: 100 Points Per Sprint
- **Rationale**: There are 380 total points of User Stories planned in our backlog which are planned to complete throughout the bootcamp. There are four sprints so we divided by four and rounded up to an even 100. This will allow us to plan all of the user stories throughout the next four sprints.

- **Stories pulled into backlog**: Our backlog is ordered in terms of what needs to get done first, we, the developers, pulled the maximum stories into our sprint from the top of the backlog that did not exceed our forecasted points.

- All stories are less than half of our current forecast.
- User stories were decomposed into tasks, in our Miro board, red items are tasks, and blue items are user stories as outlined by the key.

- **Daily Scrums**: Scrums were completed in our slack channel when not able to meet on weekends due to time constraints of people. Documentation of each days minutes are located in the minutes folder of our github repo. These minutes include what everyone did, what they plan to do, and what the impediments were, if any.

- **Impediment Removal Plan**: Swarm the impediment as a team to come up with a solution or workaround to unblock the impediment.

- **Sprint board update and Burndown Updates**: Screenshots of burndown updates are above. Screenshots of board below.

- **Sprint Review**: 
Decision made: Database creation task is required for the retrieval of the information using the email. It is not required for form page. Moving to next sprint PBI for revisiting quotation. Part 2 held on 11/15 with the stakeholder.

- **Sprint Retrospective Actions:**
  - Update User Stories to be more user story accurate
  - Take out unused functionality
  - Include unit tests in order to ensure robustness (This is in the backlog)
  - Come up with definition of done (We completed this in the retro and moved it to completed because we thought it was important to do quickly.)

-**Other**: We came up with a Definition of Done after the retro so that we know when we can close a user Story. Definition is:

- All related backlog items to user story are done
- Product owner approval
- Acceptance criteria met for each story
- New unit tests passed
- No bugs introduced, all prior tests still pass
